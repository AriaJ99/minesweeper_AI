# minesweeper_AI
minesweeper code and its AI in cpp
this is my first README file ever. Thus it may not seem too good!!!
this code contains the Minesweeper game, its AI as an option to have the ability to play it casually or solve it with AI
the game implementation was written two years ago as a project in which I wasn't allowed to use any stl data structure and that's the reason why some parts code seems very rudimentary
the algorithm complete explanation is in https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/
#: unknown cell
@: flagged cell
&: bomb cell that has been chosen
*: other bombs
number: count of surrounding cells bombs
**Bomb expand is an unused function, however, I decided not to delete it
