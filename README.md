# minesweeper_AI
minesweeper code and its AI in cpp
this is my first README file ever so it may not seem to good!!!
this code contains minesweeper game and its AI as an option to have ability  to play it casualy or solve it with AI
the game implementaion part has been written two years ago as an project which I wasn't allowed to use any stl data structure and that's the reason why some parts code seems very rudimentary
the algorithm complete explanation is in https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/
#: unknown cell
@: flagged cell
&: bomb cell which has been chosen
*: other bombs
number: count of surounding cells bombs
**bomb expand is an unused function but I decided to not delete it
